This repository consists on the last stage reached during development on a project at CEIT UQ during Summer Semester. The culmination of it has resulted in arduino webserver code which allows http post requests to specify arduino commands for devices connected to different pins as well as a json scratch extension which uses node-red to send these pre-made http requests to the arduino on use of the corresponding block inside of scratch itself.
